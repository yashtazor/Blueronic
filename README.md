## AIM: 
This project aims specifically at segregating the supply chain activities in a smart manner on the basis of a particular disease or the symptoms exhibited by the patient and having machine learning algorithms do this in a much more effective procedure than manual techniques, under the constraint that substantial amount of data is available to drive the learning process for these algorithms and that the suggestions for the supply chain activities are at the disposal of the hospital staff in the minimum time possible.
