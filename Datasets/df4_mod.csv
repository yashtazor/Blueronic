Immediately at the time of the administration, I noticed numbness in my left pinky & ring finger that extended to my elbow.  I figured they may have ?hit a nerve? so I called my PCP afterward.  My PCP advised me to take Ibuprofen 600mg and to call the next day with any new or worsening symptoms.  When I woke up the next day, I noticed numbness in both of my feet (with continued numbness in my left forearm).  I had a visit with my PCP where I had a normal neurological exam except for the paresthesias.  I did not sleep well the night before, so I was sent home with a medication to assist in sleeping and to observe over the holidays to see if my condition improved.  Otherwise, my PCP would order more testing.   Monday after the holidays (12/28/2020), my symptoms didn?t improve.  I noticed that I have constant numbness in bilateral hands and feet with periodic episodes where my entire left leg and then my entire right arm had tingling/numbness/crawling sensation.  I had some fasting labs done on 12/29/2020: CBC, CMP, CRP, Sed Rate, TSH, Magnesium, eGFR were all within normal limits.  My B12 was slightly low at 210 (normal levels are listed as 211-911).  I received a B12 injection that same day and started OTC B12 supplements.  I am currently waiting on the referral to go through for an EMG.    Since receiving my B12 injection, I noticed a few more episodes over the New Year holiday break. From 12/31/20-01/02/21, I had this tingling/unpleasant sensation episode on my whole right side. My entire arm and leg were being affected; the episode was constant throughout most of the day with a few moments of relief with hot showers/heating blanket. No weakness noted.  I currently have a message out to my PCP to update.",OTH,Lutera,Anxiety,Anxiety,Flu,2,Y,Y,No known allergies,917961,Differential white blood cell count,Dyspnoea,Dyspnoea exertional,Electrocardiogram,Fibrin D dimer,918571,PFIZER\BIONTECH,1

The remainder of the pancreatic parenchyma is difficult to differentiate from surrounding retroperitoneal fat.  The pancreatic duct is top normal caliber at 3 mm. Unremarkable liver. Slightly distended gallbladder containing thickened partially congealed bile.  No calcified stones.  No sonographic evidence of cholecystitis.

No evidence of superficial thrombophlebitis noted. LEFT LOWER LIMB: No evidence of acute or chronic deep vein thrombosis. No evidence of superficial thrombophlebitis noted.  CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: IMPRESSION: 1. No definite acute intra-abdominal abnormality. 2. Distended gallbladder with cholelithiasis but no discernible pericholecystic inflammatory changes.  There is a tiny calcification in the porta hepatis near the base of the gallbladder, relationship to ductal structures cannot be determined on  noncontrast imaging although could potentially be vascular. There does not appear to be intrahepatic duct dilatation.  3. 1 cm indeterminate right renal nodule.   4. Possible small pancreatic cysts. 5. Colonic diverticulosis without focal diverticulitis. 6.  Mild splenomegaly. 7. Trace abdominal ascites. Although contrast imaging is preferential to evaluate the parenchymal organs, patient has impaired renal function, and noncontrast MRCP may still provide additional information regarding parenchymal organs and ductal structure findings as described.

In the right lower lung, there are interstitial infiltrates secondary to fibrosis and/or interstitial pneumonia. There is also small right pleural effusion. In the left lung, there are  bullous changes superiorly and fibrotic changes inferiorly. IMPRESSION: 10 cm lucency in the right upper lung secondary to a bulla or pneumothorax.

This exam was performed according to our departmental dose-optimization program, which includes automated exposure control, adjustment of the mA and/or kV according to  patient size and/or use of iterative reconstruction technique. IV CONTRAST:  80 mL of Omnipaque 300 Total DLP:           438.27 mGy-cm FINDINGS: The pulmonary artery is mildly enlarged measuring 3.8 cm in diameter.The opacification of the pulmonary arteries is adequate. There is no filling defect to suggest pulmonary embolism. There is no supraclavicular or axillary lymphadenopathy. There is a 3.6 cm right sided thyroid nodule resulting in subtle effacement of the trachea There is mild-to-moderate atherosclerotic disease of the thoracic aorta There is no pericardial effusion. Mediastinum and hila are negative for lymphadenopathy or mass.  The esophagus is normal in course and caliber. There is a 1.6 x 1.1 x 2.5 cm nodule within the right upper lobe. There is extensive emphysematous changes of the lung with extensive bulla formation within the right upper lobe. There is no pneumothorax. There is a moderate right simple pleural effusion with subsegmental atelectasis. The central airway is moderately compromised due to motion artifact however there appears to be complete opacification of the right lower lobe bronchus. There are also calcifications within the left lower lobe bronchi. There is a small simple left pleural effusion with associated subsegmental atelectasis. There is moderate to severe osteopenia. There is no height loss of the vertebral bodies. IMPRESSION: Severe emphysematous changes of the lung with a suspicious 1.6 x 1.1 x 2.5 cm nodule in the right upper lobe which appears similar to previous examination and may represent scar however PET scan may be of further benefit to confirm this finding. There is a moderate right and mild right pleural effusion with filling defect within the right main bronchus and left lower lobe bronchi suspicious for aspiration, underlying mass is doubtful however bronchoscopy may be of further benefit. There is no evidence of pneumothorax. There are large bulla within the lung apices 3.6 cm right thyroid gland nodule that would BE better assessed with nonemergent ultrasound There is no pulmonary embolism however please correlate for pulmonary hypertension  Electronically signed by:  DO  2/2/2021 12:44 PM       Assessment:   Active Hospital Problems   Diagnosis Date Noted ?

Upon arrival to triage she was obviously dyspneic with significantly low oxygen saturations. O2 sats on arrival were 65%, improved to mid 90's with O2 6 liters per NC. Admitting diagnosis: hypoxic respiratory failure post COVID vaccine. Lab work shows an elevation of the BUN and creatinine at 31 and 1.71 which is slightly higher than her usual baseline levels. BNP is elevated at 2 448 with a mildly elevated troponin. Procalcitonin is also elevated. Patient's white blood cell count is 11/07. Full viral panel including COVID-19 is not detected. All blood cultures and respiratory cultures were negative. Patient chest x-ray shows numerous bilateral patchy opacities which is significantly different from her previous chest x-ray here. Empiric rejection treatment initiated including high dose methylprednisolone, plasmapheresis, IVIG, Thymoglobulin. She continued to decline and ultimately required intubation, proning and paralyzing on 2/8/2021 and the VV ECMO cannulation on 2/13/2021. EGD done 2/14/2021 as unable to pass the TEE probe during cannulation prior day (unable to complete due to abnormal anatomy). Acute pupil exam change in the early am hours of 2/15/2021 prompted urgent head CT which revealed catastrophic brain bleed. Brainstem reflexes were lost soon after. Despite placing an EVD emergently at bedside, brain stem reflexes were not recovered. GOL engaged and patient not an organ donation candidate.
